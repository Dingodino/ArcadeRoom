    "description": "<p>Neo Geo CD (Japanese: ネオジオCD Hepburn: Neo Jio Shī Dī?) is the second home video game console of SNK Corporation's Neo Geo family, released in September 1994, four years after its cartridge-based equivalent. This is the same platform, converted to the cheaper CD format retailing at $49 to $79 per title, compared to the $300 cartridges. The system was originally priced at US$399, or £399 in the UK. The unit's 1X CD-ROM drive is slow, with very long loading times of up to 56 Mbit of data per load.[citation needed] The system can also play Audio CDs. All three versions of the system have no region-lock.</p><p>The Neo Geo CD was launched bundled with a control pad instead of a joystick like the AES version. However, the original AES joystick can be used with all three Neo Geo CD models.</p><p>As of March 1997, the Neo Geo CD had sold 570,000 units worldwide</p>",
